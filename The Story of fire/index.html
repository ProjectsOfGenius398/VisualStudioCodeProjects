                has been identified from charcoal in rocks formed during the late 
                Silurian Period, around 420 million years ago. ... We know that there were also periods through 
                Earth history when oxygen levels in the atmosphere were higher than today.</h2>

                 study of the history of wildfires, is a subdiscipline of fire ecology.
                 Patterns of forest fires in historical and prehistorical time provide information
                  relevant to the pattern of vegetation in modern landscapes.
                  It provides an estimate of the historical range of variability of a natural
                   disturbance regime, and can be used to identify the processes affecting the 
                   occurrence of fire. Fire history reconstructions are achieved by compiling atlases of past 
                   fires, using the tree ring record from fire scars and tree ages, and the charcoal record
                    from soils and sediments.</h2>
