                    <h1>The basics of Perimeter</h1>
                    <H3>1. Perimeter is the number that we get by adding the length of all the sides of a figure</H3>
                    <H3>2. To measure the perimeter of a square we multiply a side's length by 4. Example: If the 
                    length of a side of a square is 4 cm, then the perimeter if 4 X 4, which is 16 cm</H3>
                    <h3>3. To measure the perimeter of a rectangle , we do length + breadth X 2. Example: If the lenght of 
                    a  rectangle is 10 cm and the breadth is 5 cm, then 10 + 5 x 2.The answer is 30cm</h3>

                    <h3>2.It is measured in square meters</h3>
                    <h3>3.To measure the area of a square, we multiply side X side</h3>
                    <h3>4.Example, a square with a side length of 6 cm will have an area of 36 square centimeters</h3>
                    <h3>5.To measure the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length by the breadth</h3>
                    <h3>6.Example, a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a breadth of 5 cm with have an area of 15 square centimeters</h3>
